1. **任务分析**

` `The main purpose of this task is to consolidate and strengthen our software programming specifications; Improve the modeling and abstraction ability of object-oriented software; Because the function of the sample engineering code is less and imperfect, we use GitHub as a team to develop tools and platforms, complete the code development, expand the game function, and cultivate our team collaborative development ability. We therefore decided to develop the game called Ludo

1. **程序设计与开发**
**
` `Ludo is simplification of the Indian game Pachisi. Invented at the end of the nineteenth century, Ludo has been a popular game from then till now. Though the player has some choice in what to do, luck dominates in deciding who wins and who loses, making it an excellent game to play against children.

Up to four players each have four pieces, which they race around the outside of a cross-shaped board according to the throws of a single six-sided die. Once a piece has completed a circuit, it turns towards the centre of the board where it finishes its journey. The first player to get all four pieces to the centre wins the game.

1. **开发分支模型与代码合并**

04 branches were created for this project: master , publish, develop and feat.

- Master: No other modifications are accepted except the merge from the publish branch.
- Develop branch: This branch is mainly used as an integration test branch, and all test environments deploy this branch for testing. 
- Feat branch: Used for function development. This branch is pulled and created from the develop branch every time, and then it is upgraded and merged into the develop branch after development.
- Publish branch: Used in pre-production environment and production environment release. For the final version, you can publish the Tag, automatically publish it through Actions configuration, package it and put it in the publish branch.

First, the team leader divides the develop and publish branches on the basis of the master branch. Then select the first function to branch out the feature branch on the basis of the develop branch.

The team develops locally, and after the self-test has no problem, it initiates a request to merge to the feature branch, and gives a commit, labeled feat(feature).

When a function is fully developed, a request is made to merge the contents of the feature branch into the develop branch.

Every time you push to the feature branch, you can check the format of the code and run the test through actions.

After all this the code is merged and pushed to the master branch

Some issues were also raised on GitHub 





1. **任务成果**

The user need to login first

Then he can access the game dashboard and choose the game he wants to play

Now he can start to play



1. **过程问题记录与分析**
1. There is not much problem in the process of annotating and labeling the code logic function, many functions like throw for rolling the dice were added correctly, which is not particularly difficult.
1. In the process of code structure analysis, how to draw UML diagrams we encountered problems, because some knowledge about UML class diagrams has not been firmly remembered, and the definitions of various relationships such as combination and aggregation are not clearly remembered. So we first reviewed the contents of the basic course of software engineering and looked back at PPT to arouse my memory. Then the code structure was carefully analyzed. We figured that we needed to first sit and choose what kind of model we want to use before starting to write any code.
1. We have used the Typora tool before, and we are familiar with the grammar of markdown mode, so the report is quite handy to write.
1. At the beginning of the task, our group discussed the division of labor first, and determined which functions to expand and how to hand over communication. After negotiating the code standards, they put themselves into their respective functional development. During the whole process, everyone helped each other and learned from each other's strengths, which was a great team development experience.

On the basis of the last task, we got a certain understanding of git, GitHub, their usage and principle, though we need to learn a bit more how to use GitHub to avoid some problems we had encountered this time but creating branches and merging branches wasn’t really difficult.












1. **实践总结**

In this practical course, we got in touch with a lot of software programming tools like git,github,xamp.. Learned how to use them to maintain personal code version, and understood its working principle and basic usage. Those are indispensable tools for us to develop large-scale software engineering projects in the future and plays a very important role in team collaborative development.

We also know the code annotation rules based on Javadoc standard, and have a certain understanding of it.

In the first task, we reviewed the knowledge of basic courses of software engineering, reviewed the drawing methods and standards of UML diagrams, and analyzed the code structure of sample projects, realizing the importance of code structure analysis in project development and deepening on our understanding of code structure.

Master the software project management mechanism based on GitHub.

In this task, we used the Java swing GUI designer to realize simple visual function management and consolidate our knowledge.

The most important thing is the collaborative development of the group. We have completed a small software project development based on GitHub platform, which shows the importance of communication, cooperation and complementarity.
